# HCMS-2XXX
A simple software driver for displaying ASCII text on HCMS-2XXX Series 5x7 Dot Matrix Character Displays.

I found existing software for these displays to be difficult to locate, and the code I did locate was not as user friendly as I wanted, so I wrote my own implementation.

Please follow the datasheet for wiring your displays. Some external components are required, like PNP transistors to drive the 5 column drivers.

The following display models _should_ work with this code:
- HDSP-201X/-231X/-235X
- HCMS-201X Series
- HCMS-231X Series
- HCMS-235X Series
- HCMS-2010
- HCMS-2011
- HCMS-2012
- HCMS-2013
- HCMS-2310
- HCMS-2311
- HCMS-2312
- HCMS-2313
- HCMS-2314
- HCMS-2351
- HCMS-2352
- HCMS-2353
- HCMS-2354
